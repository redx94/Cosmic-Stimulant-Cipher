# Cosmic Stimulant Cipher

A quantum-inspired encryption system that leverages principles from quantum field theory and cosmology to create a robust and future-proof cipher.

## Features

- **Quantum Field Generation**: Simulates vacuum fluctuations and quantum potentials
- **Dark Entropy Collection**: Utilizes cosmic expansion and dark matter effects
- **Advanced Visualization**: View attractors, quantum entropy, and Casimir effects
- **DNA-based Key Expansion**: Biological-inspired key strengthening
- **Quantum Simulation**: Entanglement and decoherence effects

## Security Features

- 128-bit minimum quantum random seeds
- Cryptographic hashing of seeds for uniform distribution
- Parameter validation to ensure chaotic behavior
- Input validation for all operations
- Unicode support with UTF-8 encoding

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
python test_cipher.py
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python -m unittest test_cipher.py -v
```

Test coverage includes:
- Quantum seed generation
- Encryption/decryption of various text types
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Long message handling
- Unicode character support

## Usage

```python
from cosmic_cipher import generate_cosmic_seed, chaotic_to_keystream, encrypt, decrypt
from chaotic_generator import generate_stellar_sequence

# Generate seed and keystream
seed = generate_cosmic_seed()
sequence = generate_stellar_sequence(seed)
keystream = chaotic_to_keystream(sequence)

# Encrypt message
message = "Hello, Cosmic Cipher! ðŸŒŒ"
ciphertext = encrypt(message, keystream)

# Decrypt message
decrypted = decrypt(ciphertext, keystream)
```
